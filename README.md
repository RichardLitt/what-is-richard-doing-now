# What Is Richard Doing Now?

This is a simple site for me to publicly declare my intention about what I am focusing on at the moment. What did you expect?

## Fine-grained epistemological questions

*Don't you do multiple things at once?*

Yes, but I don't really need to write 'breathing'. This is more about what my focus is right now.

*What about thematic? How far down the ladder of meaning and understanding will you go?*

As far as I need to go to make it salient to myself that _this is the thing that I am doing_.

*Can I get live updates or something?*

Feel free to suggest a way of doing that.

*How long will this go on for?*

I don't care. As long as I find it useful, I suppose. Let's try and do it all day today.

*You are behind on X project, can you do that instead?*

Feel free to suggest stuff. But maybe also be aware that I am a human with my own set of coordinates and desires, and they may not align with yours, or even with my own internal goals and dreams? Life is difficult.

*How can I support you?*

Talk to me. WhatsApp, Signal, Twitter, email. This can be a collaborative thing.

*Why not use Twitch or just Twitter or something?*

Because I like this way.
